I joined [Data Driven Logistics Ltd.](https://www.datadrivenlogistics.com/), a local logistics software company, working as a full stack developer.
My primary role was working with React, .NET Core, and MS SQL Server.

I worked on a team to rewrite the core product from a dated ASP.NET and JQuery application to a modern React and .NET Core application.
This saw performance improvements of up to 5x in some areas, and a much more modern and user-friendly interface.
